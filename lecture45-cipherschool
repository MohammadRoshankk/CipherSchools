In this lecture, we were introduced to greedy algorithms, which solve problems by making the best local choice at each step, aiming for a globally optimal solution.
Greedy algorithms are straightforward and efficient for specific problems. 
However, they don't always guarantee the best solution for all problems. 
Understanding when to apply greedy algorithms is crucial for effective problem-solving.
