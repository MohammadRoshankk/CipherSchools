In this class, we learned about the importance of analyzing algorithms for efficient code. 
The efficiency of code depends on the number of statements executed, which affects its time complexity. Using sorting algorithms as examples, we explored how to evaluate code efficiency. 
We also received a brief introduction to best and worst-case scenarios, helping us understand how algorithms perform under different conditions.
